# Shquizzer

Create and take quizzes from Google Sheets

Using this app you can specify a Google Sheet from which to 
pull data, and the app will create a multiple choice quiz
for you to take.

This was initially created to help my daughter study for
her USA State/Capital test in 5th grade.

## Building

This is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project, so follow instructions on how to work
